Welcome to Project Conga
=========================

Hi! We're working on "EngSci Courses", codenamed *Project Conga*. In a sense, it's the spiritual successor to
unavoidable.ca (which I'm sure you guys have used before). 

Our first launch of Project Conga will be focused on providing a hassle-free, dead-easy note-sharing experience
for all of us EngScis. We hope to get this up by Saturday. So we *need* your help!

If you're here, you've probably been "recruited" here through other means. So you know what to do next.

So have fun everyone!
